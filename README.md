# ToDo App (Full Stack)
**ToDo App** is a full-stack web application that allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently. It combines a **React + Tailwind CSS frontend** with a **Node.js + Express backend** and uses **MongoDB for secure data storage**. The app provides a smooth and responsive experience with persistent task management.

# Frontend (Client)
# Features
- **Add, Edit, and Delete Tasks** – Manage daily to-do items easily
- **Persistent Data** – All tasks are stored in MongoDB for future access
- **Responsive UI** – Works seamlessly on all screen sizes
- **Interactive Design** – Built using React components
- **Modern Styling** – Tailwind CSS for a clean, modern look
- **API Integration** – Communicates with backend for real-time updates

# Technologies Used
- **React** – for dynamic UI and component rendering
- **Tailwind CSS** – for responsive, utility-first styling
- **HTML5** – for structured layout
- **Axios / Fetch API** – for backend communication

# Backend (Server)
# Features
- **Express REST API** – Handles all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
- **MongoDB Integration** – Stores user tasks securely
- **CORS Enabled** – Ensures safe frontend-backend communication
- **Error Handling** – Manages invalid routes and requests gracefully
- **Environment Variables** – Securely stores configuration details

# Technologies Used
- **Node.js** – for backend runtime environment
- **Express.js** – for API routes and middleware
- **MongoDB** – for database management
- **Mongoose** – for schema and data modeling
- **dotenv** – for managing environment variables

# How It Works
User adds a task from the frontend
The task is sent to the backend through an API request
Backend stores the task in MongoDB
Data is fetched and displayed dynamically on the React frontend
Users can edit or delete tasks in real time
